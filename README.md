# PyBer_Analysis Ride Share Analysis

## Purpose of the analysis

The analysis has three main objectives:
- provide a technical summary of the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type,
- provide a line chart using the 586 style to show the sums of fares per week for the first four (4) months of 2019, and,
- draw reasonable conclusions from the analysis that could help effectively direct resources and support where it needed.

Data from two related datasets (driver data and city data) were combined to come up with the main metrics that were being investigated.
